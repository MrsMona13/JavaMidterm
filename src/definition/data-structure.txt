***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: We need data structure to store and organize data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Some various operations that can be performed on different data structures are insertion, deletion,
        traversal, searching, and sorting.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: In the real world, we use data structures to store and organize data. For example, a store that stores and
        saves customer's emails for later use for things like sales, events, ect.

What is an Array?
Answer: An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure that needs to be traversed starting from the head node until the end
        of the list.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: Arrays lack efficiency for insertion/deletion. LinkedList are dynamic and have faster insertion/deletion time.

What is a Queue?
Answer: A queue is like a line in which it keeps adding to the line and then removing them starting with the first in
        line.

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO is first in first out and LIFO is last in first out. This is referring to the data structure.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O notation is used to describe the speed of an algorithm.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case to search an element from an array is using a linear search.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The worst case to search an element from an array is if the element we are searching for is the last element
        in the array.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree data structure is where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A graph data structure is basically a point or something that connects all different points together.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: The difference between HashTable and HashMap is that HashTable is thread safe and HashMap is not thread safe.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
Answer:In RDMS we use Arrays, in Network data model we use graphs, and in Hierarchical data model we use trees.

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: HashMaps in Java are basically a data structure that allows us to store objects and then we can retreive it in
        real time. The way that HashMaps store values is tt uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for
        storing the Key and the Value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index
        which is not present in the array. If the index excedes the size of an array, that is when an
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: The different ways of copying an array into another array is by doing it manually, copying the element, and
        cloning.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: BFS stands for Breadth First Search and DFS stands for Depth First Search. BFS finds the shortest path and DFS goes
        all the way to the end or bottom and then starts going back.

What is Recursion?
Answer: Recursion is a method that calls itself to solve a problem.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: A linear data structure is where data are arranged sequentially or linearly. Non-linear structures are when
        data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly.


Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:
Answer: The different sorting algorithms are Insertion, selection, bubble, merge, and quick sort. The quick sort time
        comlexity is O(n log(n)). The selection time complexity is O(n2). The insertion time complexity is O(n). The
        bubble time complexity is O(n). The merge time complexity is O(n log(n)).

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a) In terms of Accessing elements:
  b) In terms of Inserting elements:
  c) In terms of Searching elements:
  d) In terms of Removing elements:
